Project Description: This project focuses on building an intelligent defect detection system for solar panels using deep learning techniques. The primary objective is to automatically identify and classify various types of surface anomalies in solar panels to enhance maintenance efficiency and reduce energy loss. The system leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify solar panel images into multiple categories such as Clean, Dusty, Bird-Drop, Electrical-Damage, Physical-Damage, and Snow-Covered.

The project includes comprehensive steps such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), image augmentation, model training, evaluation, and deployment using a user-friendly Streamlit application. It also explores object detection models (e.g., YOLO or Faster R-CNN) for locating specific defect areas on the panel surface.

Key Features:

Automated defect classification using CNN models

Optional object detection for precise defect localization

End-to-end pipeline from data cleaning to visualization

Real-time predictions with a Streamlit-based web interface

Application of SQL for storing metadata and results

Use cases in preventive maintenance, monitoring, and inspection in solar farms

Tools & Technologies Used:

Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, CNN

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for EDA)

SQL for backend integration

Streamlit for UI/UX

Business Impact: Helps reduce inspection time and manual errors, ensures better energy yield, and enables predictive maintenance scheduling for large-scale solar installations
